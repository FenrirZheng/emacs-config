;;; init-org-roam.el --- org-roam Zettelkasten over ~/code/org-roam -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Section 14 of the pre-split monolithic init.el (see git log for the move).
;; ~/code/org-roam/ holds the .org notes converted from the Obsidian vault by
;; ~/code/obsidian-to-org-roam.py (re-runnable; see CONVERSION-REPORT.txt in
;; that directory).  org-roam adds an SQLite-backed link cache on top of plain
;; .org files: every note (a file with a top-level `:ID:' property) is a "node",
;; `[[id:...]]' links between them are bidirectional, and `org-roam-buffer'
;; shows the backlinks of whatever you're viewing.
;;
;; The original .md vault at ~/code/obsidian/ still exists on disk but is no
;; longer wired into Emacs -- init-obsidian.el / obsidian.el were removed, so
;; org-roam over the converted .org notes is now the only note system here.
;;
;; First run (the archive isn't refreshed at startup -- see init.el §1):
;;   M-x my/package-refresh  ->  restart Emacs  ->  M-x org-roam-db-sync
;; org-roam pulls in `emacsql'; Emacs 30's built-in SQLite covers it.
;;
;; `org-roam-graph' (M-x) renders a static link graph via Graphviz -- it needs
;; the `dot' binary (`apt install graphviz'); use `C-u M-x org-roam-graph' to
;; draw a local subgraph rather than all ~1400 nodes at once.  `org-roam-ui'
;; below is the nicer option for a vault this size: an interactive in-browser
;; D3 graph, no Graphviz required.

;;; Code:

(use-package org-roam
  :custom
  (org-roam-directory (file-truename "~/code/org-roam"))
  ;; New note from `C-c r f' / `C-c r c': timestamp-${slug}.org with a #+title:
  ;; and a tag prompt.  `%(my/org-roam-prompt-filetags)' (defined in :config)
  ;; runs `completing-read-multiple' against the tags already in the roam DB --
  ;; so you pick from your existing vocabulary instead of inventing typo-variants;
  ;; entering nothing yields no #+filetags: line at all.  `%?' is where point
  ;; lands after capture; `:unnarrowed t' shows the whole file while capturing.

  ;; The converted daily notes (2026-05-08.org, ...) sit at the vault root, not
  ;; in a `daily/' subdir, so point org-roam-dailies there with an empty subdir.
  (org-roam-dailies-directory "")
  ;; Fixed header for daily notes.  `file+head' inserts HEAD only when the day's
  ;; file doesn't exist yet; org-roam itself prepends the :ID: drawer above it,
  ;; so a brand-new daily ends up as:
  ;;   :PROPERTIES:  /  :ID: <auto>  /  :END:
  ;;   #+title: 2026-05-13 Tuesday
  ;;   #+filetags: :daily:
  ;;   * 14:32 <point>
  ;; The `entry' body "* %<%H:%M> %?" means every C-c r d capture adds a fresh
  ;; timestamped top-level heading (a running journal); `:unnarrowed t' keeps the
  ;; whole file visible while capturing.  `%A' is the locale's full weekday name.
  ;; For a fixed content skeleton instead, put the headings in HEAD and switch
  ;; the target to `(file+head+olp "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" HEAD ("Log"))'.
